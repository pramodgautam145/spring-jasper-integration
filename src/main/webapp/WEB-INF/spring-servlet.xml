	Here we declared two resolvers. The lower numbered order takes higher precedence.
	This means the XmlViewResolver will be used first by Spring to check if there's 
	a matching view. If not, it uses InternalResourceViewResolver instead.
	
	If we set InternalResourceViewResolver's order to 0, all references to our view reports
	will be classified as JSP pages instead. This is not what we want. So we put ordering.

	Resolves view names based on the their literal names. These names are then matched

	Take note of the ordering of this ViewResolver.
